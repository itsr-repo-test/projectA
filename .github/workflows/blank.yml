# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
